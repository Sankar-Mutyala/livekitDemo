# Production-Grade Fixes for LiveKit Video Conference App

## Issues Fixed

### 1. VideoTile Audio Context Error
**Problem**: `createMediaElementSource` error due to multiple AudioContexts trying to connect to the same audio element.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented global AudioContext singleton to prevent multiple contexts
- Added proper cleanup and connection state management
- Enhanced audio analyser with better error handling and smoothing

### 2. Video Track Attachment Issues
**Problem**: Video tracks weren't properly attaching to video elements, causing blank video displays.

**Solution**:
- Improved track attachment logic with proper error handling
- Added connection state validation before track operations
- Enhanced cleanup to prevent memory leaks

### 3. Connection Stability Issues
**Problem**: Frequent disconnections and reconnection loops causing poor user experience.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced reconnection policy with exponential backoff and jitter
- Added connection timeouts and proper error handling
- Implemented connection health monitoring
- Added STUN servers for better NAT traversal

### 4. Track Publishing Failures
**Problem**: Camera/microphone toggle failures due to connection timeouts and publishing issues.

**Solution**:
- Added timeout handling for all track operations
- Implemented immediate UI state updates for better UX
- Enhanced error messages with specific failure reasons
- Added loading states to prevent multiple simultaneous operations

### 5. Audio/Video Controls Issues
**Problem**: Controls didn't work properly for all participants and lacked proper feedback.

**Solution**:
- Added loading states and disabled states for controls
- Implemented proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- Enhanced state management for immediate UI updates
- Added visual feedback for operation status

## Production-Grade Improvements

### 1. Error Boundary
- Added React Error Boundary to catch and handle component errors gracefully
- Production error logging and monitoring integration
- User-friendly error messages with recovery options

### 2. Logging and Monitoring
- Comprehensive logging system with different log levels
- Performance monitoring for critical operations
- Connection health monitoring with automated checks
- Production-ready error tracking integration points

### 3. Enhanced Connection Management
- Exponential backoff reconnection strategy
- Connection timeout handling
- Health check monitoring
- Proper cleanup and resource management

### 4. Improved User Experience
- Loading states for all async operations
- Immediate UI feedback for user actions
- Better error messages with actionable guidance
- Prevention of duplicate operations

### 5. Code Quality
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Proper error handling throughout
- Memory leak prevention
- Performance optimizations

## Key Features Added

### 1. Global AudioContext Management
```typescript
// Prevents multiple AudioContext creation
let globalAudioContext: AudioContext | null = null;
const getGlobalAudioContext = () => {
  if (!globalAudioContext) {
    globalAudioContext = new (window.AudioContext || (window as any).webkitAudioContext)();
  }
  return globalAudioContext;
};
```

### 2. Enhanced Connection Configuration
```typescript
// Production-grade connection settings
reconnectPolicy: {
  nextRetryDelayInMs: (context) => {
    const baseDelay = Math.min(1000 * Math.pow(2, context.retryCount), 30000);
    const jitter = Math.random() * 1000;
    return baseDelay + jitter;
  },
  maxRetries: 10,
},
```

### 3. Performance Monitoring
```typescript
// Track performance of critical operations
return PerformanceMonitor.measureAsync('livekit-connect', async () => {
  // Connection logic
});
```

### 4. Health Monitoring
```typescript
// Monitor connection health
connectionHealthMonitor.addHealthCheck('livekit-connection', () => {
  return Promise.resolve(this.room?.state === 'connected');
});
```

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Start the Application
```bash
npm start
```

### 2. Join a Room
- Enter room name and participant name
- Click "Join Room"
- Grant camera/microphone permissions when prompted

### 3. Video/Audio Controls
- **Microphone**: Click to mute/unmute (shows loading state)
- **Camera**: Click to turn on/off (shows loading state)
- **Screen Share**: Click to share screen
- **Leave Room**: Click to exit the room

### 4. Debug Features
- **Debug Button**: Shows connection status and participant info
- **Refresh Button**: Refreshes video tracks
- **Enable Button**: Enables camera and microphone
- **Reconnect Button**: Forces reconnection

## Production Deployment

### 1. Environment Variables
```bash
REACT_APP_LIVEKIT_URL=wss://your-livekit-server.com
NODE_ENV=production
```

### 2. Error Monitoring Integration
Update `src/lib/logger.ts` to integrate with your monitoring service:
```typescript
// Example for Sentry
if (window.Sentry) {
  window.Sentry.captureException(entry.error || new Error(entry.message), {
    extra: entry.context,
    tags: { component: 'livekit-app' }
  });
}
```

### 3. Token Server
Ensure you have a proper token server running for production:
```javascript
// Example token server endpoint
app.post('/api/token', async (req, res) => {
  const { roomName, participantName } = req.body;
  const token = generateToken(roomName, participantName);
  res.json({ token });
});
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Video not showing**
   - Check browser permissions for camera
   - Verify LiveKit server is running
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **Audio not working**
   - Check browser permissions for microphone
   - Verify audio device is not muted
   - Check browser audio settings

3. **Connection issues**
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify LiveKit server URL is correct
   - Check firewall settings

4. **Performance issues**
   - Check browser performance in DevTools
   - Monitor network usage
   - Check for memory leaks

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 80+
- Firefox 75+
- Safari 13+
- Edge 80+

## Security Considerations

- Always use HTTPS in production
- Implement proper token authentication
- Validate all user inputs
- Use secure WebRTC configurations
- Implement rate limiting on your token server

## Performance Optimizations

- Adaptive streaming with simulcast layers
- Efficient audio/video codec selection
- Connection pooling and reuse
- Memory leak prevention
- Optimized reconnection strategies

This implementation follows industry best practices for production-grade video conferencing applications with LiveKit.
